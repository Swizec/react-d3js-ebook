# Animating with React, Redux, and d3

And now for some pure nerdy fun: A particle generator ... or, well, as close as you can get with React and D3. You'd need WebGL for a *real* particle generator.

We're making tiny circles fly out of your mouse cursor. Works on mobile with your finger too.

To see the particle generator in action, [go here](http://swizec.github.io/react-particles-experiment/). Github won't let me host different branches, so you'll see the advanced 20,000 particle version from next chapter.

We're using the [game loop](#game-loop) approach to animation and Redux to store the state tree and drive changes for each frame.

You can see the full code [on GitHub](https://github.com/Swizec/react-particles-experiment). Code samples in this chapter focus more on the Redux part because that's what's new.

It's going to be great.

## Here's how it works

We use **React to render everything**: the page, the SVG element, the particles inside. This lets us tap into React's algorithms that decide which nodes to update and when to garbage collect old nodes.

Then we use some **d3 calculations and event detection**. D3 has great random generators, so we take advantage of that. D3's mouse and touch event handlers calculate coordinates relative to our SVG. We need those, and React's click handlers are based on DOM nodes, which don't correspond to `(x, y)` coordinates. D3 looks at real cursor position on screen.

All **particle coordinates are in a Redux store**. Each particle also has a movement vector. The store holds some useful flags and general parameters, too. This lets us treat animation as data transformations. I'll show you what I mean in a bit.

We use **actions to communicate user events** like creating particles, starting the animation, changing mouse position, and so on. On each requestAnimationFrame, we **dispatch an "advance animation" action**.

On each action, the **reducer calculates a new state** for the whole app. This includes **new particle positions** for each step of the animation.

When the store updates, **React flushes changes** via props and because **coordinates are state, the particles move**.

The result is smooth animation.

## 3 presentation components

We start with the presentation components because they're the least complicated. To render a collection of particles, we need:

- a stateless `Particle`
- a stateless `Particles`
- a proper `App`

None of them contain state, but `App` has to be a proper component so that we can use `componentDidMount`. We need it to attach D3 event listeners.

### Particle

The `Particle` component is a circle. It looks like this:

{caption: "Particle component"}
```javascript
// src/components/Particles/Particle.jsx
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';

const Particle = ({ x, y }) => (
	<circle cx={x} cy={y} r="1.8" />
);

Particle.propTypes = {
	x: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
	y: PropTypes.number.isRequired
};

export default Particle;
```

It takes `x` and `y` coordinates and returns an SVG circle.

### Particles

The `Particles` component isn't much smarter – it returns a list of circles wrapped in a grouping element, like this:

{caption: "Particles list"}
```javascript
// src/components/Particles/index.jsx
import React from 'react';

import Particle from './Particle';

const Particles = ({ particles }) => (
	<g>{particles.map(particle =>
		<Particle key={particle.id}
		          {...particle} />
		)}
	</g>
);

export default Particles;
```
		
Walk through the array of particles, render a Particle component for each. Declarative rendering that you've seen before :)

We can take an array of `{id, x, y}` objects and render SVG circles. Now comes our first fun component: the `App`.

### App

`App` takes care of rendering the scene and attaching d3 event listeners. It's not _really_ a presentation component because it gets actions via props and uses ties them to mouse events. This is a Redux faux par, but works well in practice.

The rendering part looks like this:

{caption: "App component"}
```javascript
// src/components/index.jsx

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import d3 from 'd3';

import Particles from './Particles';
import Footer from './Footer';
import Header from './Header';

class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div onMouseDown={e => this.props.startTicker()} style={{overflow: 'hidden'}}>
			     <Header />
			     <svg width={this.props.svgWidth}
			          height={this.props.svgHeight}
			          ref="svg"
			          style={{background: 'rgba(124, 224, 249, .3)'}}>
			         <Particles particles={this.props.particles} />
			     </svg>
			     <Footer N={this.props.particles.length} />
			 </div>
		);
	}
}
			
export default App;
```

There's more going on, but the gist is that we return a `<div>` with a `Header`, a `Footer`, and an `<svg>`. Inside `<svg>`, we use `Particles` to render many circles. The Header and Footer components are just some helpful text.

Notice that the core of our rendering function only says *"Put all Particles here, please"*. There's nothing about what's moved, what's new, or what's no longer needed. We don’t have to worry about that.

We get a list of coordinates and naively render circles. React takes care of the rest. If you ask me, that's the real magic here.

Oh, and we call `startTicker()` when a user clicks on our scene. No reason to have the clock running *before* any particles exist.

#### D3 event listeners

To let users generate particles, we have to wire up some functions in `componentDidMount`. It looks like this:

{caption: "Event listeners"}
```javascript
// src/components/index.jsx

class App extends Component {
	componentDidMount() {
		let svg = d3.select(this.refs.svg);

		svg.on('mousedown', () => {
		    this.updateMousePos();
		    this.props.startParticles();
		});
		svg.on('touchstart', () => {
		    this.updateTouchPos();
		    this.props.startParticles();
		});
		svg.on('mousemove', () => {
		    this.updateMousePos();
		});
		svg.on('touchmove', () => {
		    this.updateTouchPos();
		});
		svg.on('mouseup', () => {
		    this.props.stopParticles();
		});
		svg.on('touchend', () => {
		    this.props.stopParticles();
		});
		svg.on('mouseleave', () => {
		    this.props.stopParticles();
		});

	}

	updateMousePos() {
		let [x, y] = d3.mouse(this.refs.svg);
		this.props.updateMousePos(x, y);
	}

	updateTouchPos() {
		let [x, y] = d3.touches(this.refs.svg)[0];
		this.props.updateMousePos(x, y);
	}
```

There are several events we take into account:

- `mousedown` and `touchstart` turn on particle generation
- `mousemove` and `touchmove` update the mouse location
- `mouseup`, `touchend`, and `mouseleave` turn off particle generation

Inside our event callbacks we use `updateMousePos` and `updateTouchPos` to update Redux state. They use `d3.mouse` to get new `(x, y)` coordinates relative to our SVG element and call Redux actions passed-in via props. The particle generation step uses this data as each particle's initial position. 

You'll see that in the next section. Yes, it smells convoluted. We need a reference to a mouse event to get the cursor position, and we want to decouple particle generation from event handling.

Remember, React isn't smart enough to figure out mouse position relative to our drawing area. React knows that we clicked a DOM node. [D3 does some magic](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/src/event/mouse.js) to find exact coordinates.

Touch events return lists of coordinates. One for each finger. We use only the first coordinate because shooting particles out of multiple fingers would make this example too convoluted.

That's it for rendering and user events. [107 lines of code](https://github.com/Swizec/react-particles-experiment/blob/master/src/components/index.jsx).

## 6 Redux Actions

Redux actions are a fancy way of saying *"Yo, a thing happened!"*. They're functions you call to get structured metadata that's passed into Redux reducers..

Our particle generator users 6 actions. The most complicated one looks like this:

[TODO: check this code still valid]
{caption: "Actions"}
```javascript
// src/actions/index.jsx
export const CREATE_PARTICLES = 'CREATE_PARTICLES';

export function createParticles(N, x, y) {
	return {
		type: CREATE_PARTICLES,
		x: x,
		y: y,
		N: N
	};
}
```
		
It tells the reducer to create `N` particles at `(x, y)` coordinates. You'll see how that works when we look at the Reducer, and you'll see how it triggers when we look at the Container.

Actions *must* have a `type`. Reducers use the type to decide what to do.

[Our other actions](https://github.com/Swizec/react-particles-experiment/blob/master/src/actions/index.js) are `tickTime`, `tickerStarted`, `startParticles`, `stopParticles`, and `updateMousePos`. You can guess what they mean :)

Personally, I think this is the least elegant part of Redux. It might make sense in big applications, but it feels unnecessary for small apps.

The whole thing smells a lot like user-defined datatypes from other languages. You give a name to a piece of shaped data. Then you use a function to generate said data. If that sounds a lot like having a named object and an object factory, or a named struct and a generator ... well that's pretty much what's going on here.

[*shrug emoji*]

## 1 Container component

Containers are React components that talk to the Redux data store.

I'm not sure this separation is necessary, especially in small projects. It's about separation of concerns. You can think of presentation components as templates that render stuff, and containers as smart-ish views that talk to controllers. Or maybe they're the controllers. 

Sometimes it's hard to tell. Basically, presentation components render and don't think, containers communicate and don't render. Redux reducers and actions think.

The gist of our `AppContainer` looks like this:

[TODO: check this code still valid]
{caption: "Main container component"}
```javascript
// src/containers/AppContainer.jsx
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import App from '../components';
import { tickTime, tickerStarted, startParticles, stopParticles, updateMousePos, createParticles } from '../actions';

class AppContainer extends Component {
	componentDidMount() {
		const { store } = this.context;
		this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =>
		    this.forceUpdate()
		);
	}

	componentWillUnmount() {
		this.unsubscribe();
	}

   // ...

	render() {
		const { store } = this.context;
		const state = store.getState();

		return (
		    <App {...state}
		         startTicker={::this.startTicker}
		         startParticles={::this.startParticles}
		         stopParticles={::this.stopParticles}
		         updateMousePos={::this.updateMousePos}
		    />
		);
	}
};

export default AppContainer;
```

We import dependencies, then we define `AppContainer` as a full-feature React `Component` because we need to use lifecycle methods. Those aren't available in functional stateless components.

Three parts of this code are important:

1. We wire up the store in `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`. Subscribe to data changes on mount, unsubscribe on unmount.
2. When rendering, we assume the store is our context, use `getState()`, then render the component we're wrapping. In this case, we render the `App` component.
3. To get the store as our context, we *have to* define `contextTypes`. It won't work otherwise. This is deep React magic.

[TODO: ^ that still true? ]

What I like about React context is that it lets us implicitly pass properties to all children components. Anything can go in context, but if you're not careful this can lead to rendering stale data.

That's why you should reserve context for passing the Redux store. All components need access, and the store itself is smart enough to handle updates.

In case you were wondering, that `{::this.startTicker}` syntax comes from ES2016. It's equivalent to `{this.startTicker.bind(this)}`. Enable `stage-0` in your Babel config to use it.

[TODO: ^ should remove that]

### AppContainer talks to the store

Congratz, you know the basics! Now we need to define those callbacks so `App` can trigger actions. Most are boilerplate-y action wrappers. Like this:

{caption: "Container-store communication"}
```javascript
// src/containers/AppContainer.jsx
class AppContainer extends Component {
	// ...
	startParticles() {
		const { store } = this.context;
		store.dispatch(startParticles());
	}

	stopParticles() {
		const { store } = this.context;
		store.dispatch(stopParticles());
	}

	updateMousePos(x, y) {
		const { store } = this.context;
		store.dispatch(updateMousePos(x, y));
	}
	// ...
}
```

Each action function gives us a `{type: ..}` object, which we dispatch on the store. You can think of dispatching sort of as triggering a global event.

Redux uses our action and goes to all our reducers and asks *"Anything you wanna do with this?"*. Reducers use the action and its properties to decide how to change the state tree. You'll see how that works in the next section.

We have to look at the `startTicker` callback before we can talk about reducers. It's where our particle generator really begins.

{title="startTicker",linenos=off,lang=js}
{caption: "startTicker"}
```javascript
// src/containers/AppContainer.jsx
class AppContainer extends Component {
	// ...
	startTicker() {
	    const { store } = this.context;

	    let ticker = () => {
	        if (store.getState().tickerStarted) {
	            this.maybeCreateParticles();
	            store.dispatch(tickTime());

	            window.requestAnimationFrame(ticker);
	        }
	    };

	    if (!store.getState().tickerStarted) {
	        console.log("Starting ticker");
	        store.dispatch(tickerStarted());
	        ticker();
	    }
	}
	// ..
}
```

Don't worry if you don't "get" this immediately. It took me a few hours to create. It's our game loop!

`startTicker` creates a `ticker` function, which calls itself on each `requestAnimationFrame`. This creates an almost infinite loop.

The loop starts in two steps:

1. Check `tickerStarted` flag and start the ticker if it hasn't been started yet. This prevents running multiple game loops in parallel. As a result, we can be naive about binding `startTicker` to `onMouseDown`.
2. Create a `ticker` function that generates particles, dispatches the `tickTime` action, and calls itself on every `requestAnimationFrame`. We check the `tickerStarted` flag each time so we can stop the animation.

Yes, that means we are asynchronously dispatching redux actions.   I wrote this code before Redux sagas were a thing. With those, you would package `startTicker` as an action that can dispatch other actions. 

This works too, I promise :)

The `maybeCreateParticles` function itself isn't too interesting. It gets `(x, y)` coordinates from `store.mousePos`, checks the `generateParticles` flag – set by mousedown – and dispatches the `createParticles` action.

That's the container. [83 lines of code](https://github.com/Swizec/react-particles-experiment/blob/master/src/containers/AppContainer.jsx).

## 1 Redux Reducer

With the actions firing and the drawing done, it's time to look at the business logic of our particle generator. We'll get it done in just 33 lines of code and some change.

Honestly? It’s a bunch of change. But the 33 lines that make up `CREATE_PARTICLES` and `TIME_TICK` changes are the most interesting. The rest is just setting various flags.

All of our logic goes in the reducer. [Dan Abramov says](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html) to think of reducers as the function you'd put in `.reduce()`. Given a state and a set of changes, how do I create the new state?

A "sum numbers" example would look like this:

{caption: "Reducer concept"}
```javascript
let sum = [1,2,3,4].reduce(sum, n => sum+n, 0);
```

For each number, take the previous sum and add the number.

Our particle generator is a more complicated version of the same concept. It takes the current application state, incorporates an action, and returns the new application state. 

To keep the example code simple, we'll put everything into the same reducer and use a big `switch` statement to decide what to do based on `action.type`. In bigger applications, we'd split our logic into domain-specific reducers. The base principle stays the same.

Let's start with the basics:

{caption: "Redux reducer basic state"}
```javascript
// src/reducers/index.js
const Gravity = 0.5,
	  randNormal = d3.random.normal(0.3, 2),
	  randNormal2 = d3.random.normal(0.5, 1.8);

const initialState = {
	particles: [],
	particleIndex: 0,
	particlesPerTick: 5,
	svgWidth: 800,
	svgHeight: 600,
	tickerStarted: false,
	generateParticles: false,
	mousePos: [null, null]
};

function particlesApp(state = initialState, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
	default:
		    return state;
	}
}

export default particlesApp;
```

This is our reducer.

We start with the gravity constant and two random generators, and define the default state:

- an empty list of particles
- a particle index, which I'll explain in a bit
- the number of particles we want to generate on each tick
- default svg sizing
- and the two flags and `mousePos` for the generator

Our reducer doesn't change anything yet. You should always at least return the same state. Otherwise you could replace the whole thing with a big `undefined` when you don't recognize an action.

### Update state to animate

For most actions, our reducer updates a single value. Like this:

{caption: "Reducer big switch"}
```javascript
// src/reducers/index.js
function particlesApp(state = initialState, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 'TICKER_STARTED':
		    return Object.assign({}, state, {
		        tickerStarted: true
		    });
		case 'START_PARTICLES':
		    return Object.assign({}, state, {
		        generateParticles: true
		    });
		case 'STOP_PARTICLES':
		    return Object.assign({}, state, {
		        generateParticles: false
		    });
		case 'UPDATE_MOUSE_POS':
		    return Object.assign({}, state, {
		        mousePos: [action.x, action.y]
		    });
		// ...
	}
}	
```

Even though we're only changing values of boolean flags and two-digit arrays, *we have to create a new state*. Redux relies on application state being immutable.

Well, JavaScript doesn't have real immutability. We pretend and make sure to never change state without making a new copy first.

We use `Object.assign({}, ...` to create a new empty object, fill it with the current state, then overwrite specific values with new ones. This is fast enough even with large state trees thanks to advancements in JavaScript engines.

You can also use a library like [immutable.js](TODO:link) to guarantee immutability. I haven't tried it yet.

Those state updates were boilerplate. The important ones are each tick of the game loop and creating new particles. They look like this:

{caption: "The particles magic"}
```javascript
// src/reducers/index.js
function particlesApp(state = initialState, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		// ...
    case 'CREATE_PARTICLES':
        let newParticles = state.particles.slice(0),
            i;

        for (i = 0; i < action.N; i++) {
            let particle = {id: state.particleIndex+i,
                            x: action.x,
                            y: action.y};

            particle.vector = [particle.id%2 ? -randNormal() : randNormal(),
                               -randNormal2()*3.3];

            newParticles.unshift(particle);
        }

        return Object.assign({}, state, {
            particles: newParticles,
            particleIndex: state.particleIndex+i+1
        });
    case 'TIME_TICK':
        let {svgWidth, svgHeight} = state,
            movedParticles = state.particles
                                  .filter((p) =>
                                      !(p.y > svgHeight || p.x < 0 || p.x > svgWidth))
                                  .map((p) => {
                                      let [vx, vy] = p.vector;
                                      p.x += vx;
                                      p.y += vy;
                                      p.vector[1] += Gravity;
                                      return p;
                                  });

        return Object.assign({}, state, {
            particles: movedParticles
        });
		// ..
	}
}
```

That looks like a bunch of code. Sort of. It's spread out.

The first part – `CREATE_PARTICLES` – copies all current articles into a new array and adds `action.N` new particles to the beginning. In my tests, this looked smoother than adding particles at the end. I don't know why. Each particle starts life at `(action.x, action.y)` and gets a random movement vector.

This randomness is another Redux faux pas. Reducers are supposed to be functionally pure: produce the same result every time they are called with the same argument values. Randomness is inherently impure.

We don't need our particle vectors to be deterministic, so I think this is fine. Let's say our universe is stochastic instead :)

{aside}
Stochastic means that our universe/physic simulation is governed by probabilities. You can still model such a universe and reason about its behavior. A lot of real world physics is stochastic in nature.
{/aside}

You could also move all this logic into the action, which would keep the reducer pure, but make it harder to see all logic in one place.

The second part – `TIME_TICK` – copies the particles array, but not each particle itself. JavaScript passes arrays by reference, which means that changing `p.vector` in a `map` mutates existing data.

This is bad from a Redux standpoint, but it’s not *too* bad unless you want to use time-traveling debugging. It works faster though :)

We filter out any particles that have left the visible area. For the rest, we add the movement vector to their position. Then we change the `y` part of the vector using our `Gravity` constant.

That's an easy way to implement acceleration.

Our reducer is done. Our particle generator works. Our thing animates smoothly. \o/

## What we learned

Building this particle generator in React and Redux, I made three important discoveries:

1. **Redux is much faster than I thought**. You'd think creating a new copy of the state tree on each animation loop was crazy, but it works. I think most our code creates only a shallow copy, which explains the speed.
2. **Adding to JavaScript arrays is slow**. Once we hit about 300 particles, adding new ones becomes visibly slow. Stop adding particles and you get smooth animation. This indicates that something about creating particles is slow: either adding to the array, or creating React component instances, or creating SVG DOM nodes.
3. **SVG is also slow**. To test the above hypothesis, I made the generator create 3000 particles on first click. The animation speed is *terrible* at first and becomes okayish at around 1000 particles. This suggests that making shallow copies of big arrays and moving existing SVG nodes around is faster than adding new DOM nodes and array elements. [Here's a gif](http://i.imgur.com/ug478Me.gif)

----

There you go. Animating with React, Redux, and d3. New superpower? Maybe.

Here's the recap:

- React handles rendering
- d3 calculates stuff
- Redux handles state
- element coordinates are state
- change coordinates on every `requestAnimationFrame`
- animation!

Now let's render to canvas and push this sucker to 20,000 smoothly animated elements even on a mobile phone.
