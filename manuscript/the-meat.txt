# Visualizing data with React and d3.js

Welcome to the main part of the book. I’m going to walk you through an example of building a simple visualization using React and d3.js.

We are going to build a subset of the code I used to visualize the salary distribution of H1B workers in the United States software industry.

If you skipped the [section on setting up your environment](#the-environment), make sure you’ve got the following dependencies:

* d3.js
* React
* Bootstrap (for styling)
* Lodash

And you should have some way of starting a static file server locally. I like `live-server`.

We’re going to put all our code in a `src/` directory, and serve the compiled version out of `build/`. A `data/` directory is going to hold our data.
