## Asynchronously loading data

Great, we’ve got a component rendering. Now we need to load some data before we can draw a picture. If you still don't have `public/data/h1bs.csv`, now is the time to get it. You can find it on Github [here](https://github.com/Swizec/h1b-software-salaries), or in the stub project included with the book.

We’re going to use d3.js’s built-in data-loading magic and hook it into React’s component lifecycle for a seamless integration. You could implement calls to a REST API in the same way.

We start by adding three methods to `H1BGraph` in `src/components/H1BGraph/index.jsx`:

{crop-start-line=54,crop-end-line=72,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Base methods to load data](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

With ES6 classes we no longer use `getInitialState` to set the initial state of our component. That job is taken over by the constructor, which is a function that gets called every time our class is instantiated into an object. We always have to call `super()` first to call the parent's constructor. In our case that's React's `Component`.

After calling `super()`, we can use `this.state` as a dictionary that hold's our component's current state. We'll want to avoid using component state as much as possible and rely instead on props fed into the component at render time. 

Next we have `componentWillMount`, which is a component lifecycle function that React calls just before mounting, also known as rendering, our component into the page. This is where you'd want to fit any last minute preparations before rendering.

It's also a great moment to start loading data. Especially when you have 12MB of data like we do. Wouldn't want to load that unless you know for sure, the component is getting rendered.

We’re going to put d3.js’s data loading magic in `loadRawData`. The reason we have a separate function and don't stick everything into `componentWillMount` is flexibility - we can call the function whenever we want without messing with React's built-in functions.

We use `d3.csv` to load our dataset because it's in CSV format. `d3.csv` understands CSV well enough to turn it into an array of dictionaries, using the first row as keys. If our data was JSON, we'd use `d3.json`, `d3.html` for HTML, etc. You can find the full list of data loaders in d3's documentation.

{crop-start-line=103,crop-end-line=115,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Load data with d3.csv](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

This asynchronously loads a CSV file, parses it, and returns the result in the `rows` argument to the callback. The callback is an ES6 fat arrow, which is syntax sugar for `function () { // .. }.bind(this)` - a function bound to current scope. We're going to use these a lot.

Inside the callback we check for errors, and if everything went well, use `this.setState()` to save the loaded data in our component's state. Calling `setState()` triggers a re-render and should generally be avoided because relying on state can lead to inconsistencies in your UI. It’s very appropriate to store 12MB of raw data as state, though.

We're now going to be able to access our data with `this.state.rawData`. Hooray!

### Data cleanup

Datasets are often messy or at least annoying to work with. After a naive load like that, our data uses keys with spaces in them and everything is a string. Not nice to work with at all.

We can add some cleanup in one fell swoop:

{crop-start-line=148,crop-end-line=172,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Data cleanup](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

Using `.row()`, we’ve given a callback to `d3.csv` that tells it how to change every row that it reads. Each row is fed into the function as a raw object, and whatever the function returns is added to the final result.

We're changing objects that look like this:

{title="Raw CSV rows",linenos=off,lang=js}
			{
			    "employer": "american legalnet inc",
			    "submit date": "7/10/2013",
			    "start date": "8/1/2013",
			    "case status": "certified",
			    "job title": "software",
			    "base salary": "80000",
			    "salary to": "",
			    "city": "encino",
			    "state": "ca"
			}

Into objects that look like this:

{title="Cleaned CSV rows",linenos=off,lang=js}
			{
			    "employer": "american legalnet inc",
			    "submit_date": "2013-07-09T22:00:00.000Z",
			    "start_date": "2013-07-31T22:00:00.000Z",
			    "case_status": "certified",
			    "job_title": "software",
			    "clean_job_title": "other",
			    "base_salary": 80000,
			    "salary_to": null,
			    "city": "encino",
			    "state": "ca"
			}

In our case we cleaned up the keys, parsed dates into `Date()` objects using d3's built-in date formatters, and made sure numbers are numbers. If a row didn’t have a `base_salary`, we filtered it out by returning `null`.

### Add visual feedback that loading is happening

Loading and parsing 81,000 data points takes some time. Let's tell users what they're waiting for by rendering some explainer text when there's no data.

{crop-start-line=244,crop-end-line=253,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Loading indicator](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

The beauty of our approach is that the `render` method returns different elements based on whether or not we’ve got some data. Notice that we access the data as `this.state.rawData` and rely on the re-render triggered by `this.setState` to get rid of the loading notice.

If you’ve kept `npm start` running in the background, your browser should flash the loading text before becoming blank.

![Loading message](images/loading_message.png)

Marvelous.

## Making your first dataviz component - a Histogram

Now that our data is loading, it’s time to start drawing.  We’ll start with a basic histogram, then add an axis, and then add an indicator for the mean value (also known as the "average").

A histogram component isn't unique to our project, so we're going to build it as a standalone component. Create a new directory `src/components/Histogram/`, with an empty `index.jsx` file.

We use `index.jsx` as a convenience to make our component easier to import so we won't put any logic in here. The whole file looks like this:

{linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[src/components/Histogram/index.jsx](code_samples/es6/Histogram/index.jsx)

It just imports and exports `Histogram`. Now the rest of our project can use `import Histogram from '../Histogram'` without understanding the internal file structure of our component. Users of your components should never have to know how you organized your component internally.

### A blank Histogram component

We start with a blank `Histogram` component in `src/components/Histogram/Histogram.jsx`, like this:

{crop-start-line=4,crop-end-line=19,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Empty histogram](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Histogram.jsx)

Just like in `H1BGraph`, we first required some external libraries - React and d3, created a class with a `render()` function, and added it to our exports. This lets other parts of the codebase use it by calling `import Histogram from './Histogram'`.

Right now the `render()` method contains only an empty grouping, `<g>`, element. These are much like divs in HTML, they hold elements together to make them easier to reference. Unlike divs, however, they don't come with any concept of formatting or sizing.

The grouping element has a class `histogram`, which we'll use later for styling, and uses the `transform` attribute to move into position via the `translate` property.

SVG transforms are a powerful tool in SVG drawing, but teaching you all about them goes beyond the scope of this book. We're only going to use the `translate()` property, which specifies a new `x, y` position for the given element.

We used ES6's string templates to create `transform`'s value. These are denoted with backticks and evaluate any JavaScript you put into `${}`. It's a great alternative to concatenating strings, but don't go crazy with these lest you won't understand what your code is doing six months from now when you have to fix a bug.

In this case, we're using this SVG transformation to give our Histogram some room to breathe. Exactly how much room comes from `this.props.topMargin` - a component property specified by whomever renders our `Histogram` component.

### d3.js for \[dataviz\] calculations

We're going to build our histogram with d3.js’s built-in histogram layout. It’s smart enough to do everything on its own. Data binning, calculating positions and dimension of histogram bars, and a few other useful tidbits. We just have to give it some data and some configuration.

We add three methods to our `Histogram` component to manage d3.js:

{crop-start-line=27,crop-end-line=47,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[D3.js management functions](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Histogram.jsx)

In `constructor()` we create the d3 objects we need and give them any defaults we know about, in `componentWillReceiveProps()` we make sure to call `this.update_d3`, and `update_d3()` is the function that does our heavy lifting. It updates d3 objects with any new properties our component gets from above.

This is the cleanest approach I’ve found to make d3.js and React work together. We’ll use it for all of our d3.js-enabled components.

The problem we're facing is that d3.js achieves its declarative nature through objects. When you call a d3.js function, it's usually got some internal state.

This is great when you want to change how d3.js behaves by daisy-chaining getters and setters, but it causes problems with React. We have to make sure to keep that internal state up-to-date.

We *could* create new objects on every `render()`, but that feels wasteful. Maybe I'm just old fashioned.

This time `update_d3()` does its heavy lifting like this:

{crop-start-line=81,crop-end-line=98,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[update_d3 function body](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Histogram.jsx)

If you’re used to d3.js, this code should look familiar. We updated the number of bins in our histogram with `.bins()` and gave it a new value accessor with `.value()`. This tells the layout how to get the interesting datapoint from our data objects.

{# this is a weird sentence #}
We’re doing one better by just passing in the function from our properties. This makes the `Histogram` component more reusable. The less we assume about what we’re doing, the better.

Then, we called `this.histogram()` to ask d3's histogram layout to do its magic. If you print the result in `bars`, you'll see it's an array of arrays that have some properties.

{title="Histogram printout",linenos=off}
	 // console.log(bars) in update_d3()
   [Array[26209], Array[48755], // ...]
    0: Array[26209]
       [0 … 9999]
       [10000 … 19999]
       [20000 … 26208]
       dx: 69999.273
       length: 26209
       x: 14.54
       y: 26209

Each array holds:
  - data for its respective histogram bin
  - a `dx` property for bar thickness
  - a `length`, which is the number of items in this bin
  - an `x` coordinate
  - a `y` coordinate

We'll use these to draw our histogram bars.

But before we can do that, we have to update our scales. You can think of scales as mathematical functions that map a domain to a range. Domain tells them the extent of our data; range tells them the extent of our drawing area. So if you have a linear scale with a domain `[0, 1]` and a range `[1, 2]` and you call `scale(0.5)`, you will get `1.5`.

To define the correct domains, we first got the `counts` of elements in each bin, then used `min`/`max` helpers to find smallest and largest values. In case of height, we had to add each bar's thickness to its position to find the max.

To define the ranges, we relied on chart dimension properties.

Notice how we use the `x` position to define the domain for our `yScale`? That's because our histogram is going to be horizontal.

We can do that so simply because scales don't care about anything, they just map a domain to a range. How you use that is up to you.

Scales are my favorite. You'll see why when we start drawing.

### React for the SVG output

Great, our scales are ready to help us draw, so let's add the drawing bit to `render()`.

{crop-start-line=151,crop-end-line=166,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Add histogram bars to SVG](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Histogram.jsx)

Even though we already calculated our histogram data in `update_d3()`, we calculate it again in `render()`. This lets us avoid using state and triggering unnecessary re-renders. It seems wasteful at first, but think about it: Which is quicker? Re-rendering twice on every prop change, or running a d3 function twice?

Ok, it's not immediately obvious which one uses less processing power, but we prefer avoiding state because it saves *our* brain cycles. Those are almost always more expensive than computer cycles.

We also added a new grouping element for the histogram bars. You'll see why we need a group inside a group later.

The more important bit is that we could just `.map()` through our histogram data even though we're technically inside XML. That's the magic of JSX - JavaScript and XML living together as one.

We could even have put the entire `makeBar` function in here, but that makes our code harder to read.

One last trick was using ES7's double-colon operator. This is syntax sugar for `this.makeBar.bind(this)`. Remember, we have to manually bind methods to `this` scope because we're using ES6 classes.

You can use this syntax sugar, if you [enabled `stage-0`](#enable-es7) in the chapter about your dev environment.

Now we need the `makeBar` method, it looks like this:

{crop-start-line=209,crop-end-line=227,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[The makeBar helper method](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Histogram.jsx)

This code uses `Histogram`'s properties and scales to calculate attributes for each bar, then passes the `props` object to a subcomponent called `HistogramBar` using a spread - `{...props}`. React's implementation of the spread operator - `...` - is more powerful than the base ES6 spread because it supports objects, not just arrays and function arguments.

You can think of it as shorthand for writing `percent={percent} x={this.props.axisMargin} y={this.yScale(bar.x)} …`.

We could have generated the SVG for a bar with a label right here, but it's going to involve some logic so I think it makes more sense as a subcomponent.

Let’s add the `HistogramBar` component.

{crop-start-line=247,crop-end-line=278,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[HistogramBar component](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Histogram.jsx)

There's nothing too special going here. Take some properties and return a grouping element with a rectangle and a text label.

Once more we used an ES6 string template to build the `transform` property, and we added some ad-hoc vertical padding to the bar to make it look better. We also used some ad-hoc calculations to place the `text` element at the end of the bar. This will make our histogram easier to read because every bar will have its percentage rendered on the crucial right edge.

Some bars are going to be too small to fit the whole label. Let's avoid rendering the label in those cases.

{crop-start-line=274,crop-end-line=290,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Adjust label for small bars](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Histogram.jsx)

We add some decimal points if we’re showing small numbers, and completely remove the label when there isn't enough room.

### Adding Histogram to the main component

Despite our magnificent `Histogram` component, the page is still blank. We have to go back to `H1BGraph/index.jsx` and tell `H1BGraph` to render the component we've just made.

First we have to import our `Histogram` component at the top of `H1Bgraph/index.jsx`. Like this:

{crop-start-line=268,crop-end-line=274,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Require Histogram](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

The reason this works so well is that `Histogram/index.jsx` file we created, which lets us `import` a directory instead of worrying about specific files inside it.

Then, we can add the histogram component to our `render` method.

{crop-start-line=317,crop-end-line=347,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Render the histogram component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

We use a `params` dictionary with our dimensions attributes, number of bins in the histogram, and the value accessor function. This makes our code cleaner and thus easier to read.

Inside the `return` statement, we made sure our `<svg>` element has a width and a height, and added the `<Histogram .. />` component. Once more we used the spread trick to feed it many `params` at once. We kept `data` as a separate attribute to make it more apparent that this component uses data.

If you kept `npm start` running, your browser should show something like this:

![Unstyled Histogram](images/unstyled_histogram.png)

So much effort to render those labels and you can't even see them. Let's add some styling to `src/components/Histogram/style.less` to make the Histogram prettier:

{crop-start-line=5,crop-end-line=19,linenos=off,lang=less}
<<[style.less](code_samples/style.less)

And make sure we `require` the styles in `H1Bgraph/index.jsx`:

{crop-start-line=360,crop-end-line=365,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Require style.less](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

You should now see a histogram like this:

![Basic Histogram](images/base_histogram.png)

## Wrapping a pure-d3 element in React - an Axis

Axes are my favourite feat of d3.js magic right after scales.  You call a function, set some parameters, and **BAM**, you’ve got an axis.

The axis automatically adapts to your data, draws the ticks, and labels them. Axes achieve this behaviour by using scales for all computation. The nice consequence of this is that you can turn a linear axis into a logarithmic axis by just changing the scale it uses.

Despite how easy axes are to use, they're pretty complex to build from scratch. Rather than recreate them in React, we're going to use a dirty little trick - give d3.js control of the DOM. Just this once.

The same approach works for wrapping any d3.js visualization in a React component.

Let's start with a blank component for the axis. It goes in `src/components/Histogram/Axis.jsx`. But it's a pretty good candidate for a general component as well.

{crop-start-line=4,crop-end-line=18,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Base axis component](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Axis.jsx)

As always we started with the imports, then defined a class - `Axis` - and exported it. We added `ReactDOM` to the usual `d3` and `React` imports because we'll need it to give d3.js a reference to our DOM node so it can take over.

Inside the `Axis` component itself, we defined a `render` method which returns an empty grouping element and uses an SVG transform to emulate margins and padding. We have to do this so d3 has something to play with when it's rendering the axis.

Just like in the `Histogram` component, we integrate d3 into our component using the `constructor`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `update_d3` methods.

{crop-start-line=27,crop-end-line=49,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Axis default properties](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Axis.jsx)

In the `constructor` we defined a new linear axis for the y coordinate, and defined a bunch of default properties for the axis:

- it uses the linear scale
- renders labels on the left
- prepends the scale's tickFormat with a `$` sign

Yes, scales have tick formatters. They take care of rendering numbers nicely. It's awesome.

Then we let `update_d3` take care of the rest. We do the same delegation in the `componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle method. The combination of these two methods calling `update_d3` ensures our d3 objects are always up to date.

The logic in `update_d3` looks like this:

{crop-start-line=84,crop-end-line=98,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Update axis state](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Axis.jsx)

Just like the previous section, we had to tell `yScale` the extent of our data and drawing area. But we didn't have to tell the axis, it already knows because the scale knows. Isn't that neat? I think it's neat.

We *did* have to get around a lot of the axis's smartness though. By default, an axis only renders a couple of ticks and labels to keep the visualization less cluttered. That would make our histogram look weird.

So we asked for the same number of ticks as there are bars, and gave a list of specific values. The axis tries to find "reasonable" label values otherwise.

Ok, we have our axis in memory. Now here's the dirty trick:

{crop-start-line=162,crop-end-line=174,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[The dirty trick for embedding d3 renders](code_samples/drawers.jsx)

I’m sure this goes against everything React designers fought for, but it works. We hook into the `componentDidUpdate` and `componentDidMount` callbacks with a `renderAxis` method. This ensures `renderAxis` gets called every time our component has to re-render.

In `renderAxis` we use `ReactDOM.findDOMNode()` to find this component's DOM node. We feed the node into `d3.select()`, which is how node selection is done in d3 land, then `.call()` the axis. This lets axis do its thing and add a bunch of SVG elements inside our node in the shape of an axis.

As a result, we re-render the axis from scratch on every update. This is inefficient because it goes around React's fancy tree diffing algorithms, but it works great.

Before we add our new `Axis` component to the Histogram, we need some styling in `src/components/H1BGraph/style.less`:

{crop-start-line=23,crop-end-line=46,linenos=off,lang=less}
<<[Styling the axis](code_samples/style.less)

Great. Now we head back to the Histogram file (src/components/Histogram/Histogram.jsx) and first add Axis to the imports, then add it to the render method.

{crop-start-line=312,crop-end-line=318,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Add Axis to Histogram imports](code_samples/es6/Histogram/Histogram.jsx)

{crop-start-line=402,crop-end-line=411,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Add Axis to Histogram.render](code_samples/drawers.jsx)

That’s it. Your histogram should look like this:

![Histogram with axis](images/axis_histogram.png)

If it doesn't, you should send me an email and I'll try to help.

Next up: making the Histogram interactive.

## Interacting with the user

We’ve got a histogram with an axis and the building blocks to make as many as we want. Awesome!

But our histogram looks weird. Most of our data falls into the first three bars and a lone outlier stretches the data range far too much.

We could take care of this by removing the outlier, but let's be honest: statisticians should worry about statistical anomalies. We’re here to draw pretty pictures.

It's better to give users some filters, so they can look only at the parts they care about. This solves our problem of finding outliers, and gives users more freedom. And maybe, just maybe, they’re going to spend more time on our site.

Win-win-win.

We're going to make controls that let users filter data by year. Then just to show you how reusable React components are, we're going to add filtering by state as well. In the full example, I also added filtering by job title, but that would take too long to explain because the dataset is messy.

![Events flow up through callbacks](images/architecture_events.jpg)

Remember, we talked about using a flux-like approach in our [architecture](#the-architecture). That means:

- user events are going to flow up the component hierarchy via callbacks
- the main component will change its data state
- React will propagate data changes back down through component props

![Updated data flows back down](images/architecture_updates.jpg)

The only difference between this bi-directional data-flow and a true Flux architecture is that in a true Flux architecture, the data store is separate from the main component. As a result, everyone has a way to affect changes directly on the data store, which means we don't have to mess about with callbacks.

That turns out to be easier to manage when you have a lot of interacting components. Because our example is so simple using Flux isn't really worth the extra code. 

To get a better idea of Flux's pros and cons, you can read this side-by-side comparison of React+Flux (130 lines) and pure jQuery (10 lines) [I wrote in October 2015](http://swizec.com/blog/reactflux-can-do-in-just-137-lines-what-jquery-can-do-in-10/swizec/6740). It's based on a simple form example.

### Adding user controls

Our controls are going to look like rows of togglable buttons. Each row represents a filter - year and state - and each button represents a value. When the button is "on", our histogram shows only the entries that have that value. Each row can have only one active value.

The end result will be something like this:

![Histogram with buttons](images/buttons_histogram.png)

We'll build the controls out of three components:

* `Controls`, which holds the controls together
* `ControlRow`, which is a row of buttons
* `Toggle`, which is a toggle-able button

These components are going to live in a `Controls` subdirectory of `H1BGraph` - `src/components/H1BGraph/Controls`. We could build controls as a standalone component, and in a way we will, but for now it's easier to assume they're a specific solution to a specific problem.

Before diving in, let's render `Controls` in `H1BGraph.render`. It's going to break the build, but you'll see things added to the page in real-time as you code. I love it when that happens.

{crop-start-line=441,crop-end-line=447,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Add Controls to H1BGraph.render](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

Notice we added `Controls` outside the `<svg>` element. That's because they aren't a part of the visualization. Not of the graphical part at least.

We used props to give our `Controls` component some data, which it will use to generate the buttons, and a filter update callback. This function doesn't do anything yet. We'll add that in a bit when we talk about propagating events back up the chain. For now it's here so that we have something to call without throwing an exception.

Don't forget to import controls at the top of the file.

{crop-start-line=372,crop-end-line=377,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Import Controls](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

Great. If you've kept `npm start` running in the background, your browser should start panicking right now. That's because `Controls/index.jsx` doesn't exist.

As always, we start with imports, a class, a render method, and exports. Like this:

{crop-start-line=4,crop-end-line=17,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Controls component stub](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

Your browser should stop panicking now. Instead, it shows a blank `<div>` under your histogram.

Now we're going to add the first `ControlRow` and break the page all over again.

{crop-start-line=31,crop-end-line=49,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Year ControlRow in Controls](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

We defined a function called `getYears` that can go through our dataset and find all year values. The `groupBy` creates a dictionary with years as keys, `keys` returns the dictionary's keys, and `map(Number)` makes sure they're all numbers so we won't have to worry about that later.

Then we added a `ControlRow` component to the return statement. As props we gave it our dataset, the `getYears` function so it can decide which buttons to render, and a dummy update filter callback.

We'll define the filter when we look at propagating events back up the chain.

And of course, don't forget to import `ControlRow`.

{crop-start-line=24,crop-end-line=28,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Import ControlRow](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

Perfect. Your browser should start panicking again.

Let's calm down your browser and create `src/components/H1BGraph/Controls/ControlRow.jsx`.

{crop-start-line=5,crop-end-line=22,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Stubbed ControlRow component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/ControlRow.jsx)

Start with imports, define a class, render some empty divs, export class. The usual.

Before your browser stops panicking, we also need the Toggle component in `src/components/H1BGraph/Controls/Toggle.jsx`.

{crop-start-line=5,crop-end-line=13,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Stubbed Toggle component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/Toggle.jsx)

Okay, your browser should stop panicking now and there should be some divs within divs under the histogram.

To make stuff show up, we first have to add toggles to ControlRow, then make sure the Toggle component returns a visible button.

#### A row of buttons

Adding buttons to `ControlRow` isn't too hard. 

The `getToggleNames` function in our props gives us a list of button names, and the `Toggle` component renders a button. All we need is a loop that places the buttons.

Let's go back to `src/components/H1BGraph/Controls/ControlRow.jsx` and add it.

{crop-start-line=53,crop-end-line=65,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Loop through toggle names](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/ControlRow.jsx)

This code calls `getToggleNames` with the data in our props, and calls `this._addToggle` on every value. Here you can once more see the power of JSX - we could embed a JavaScript incantation right in what looks like HTML code.

Now we need to define the `_addToggle` function, which returns a Toggle component. We do this in a function call so the code is easier to read.

{crop-start-line=33,crop-end-line=53,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Create a Toggle](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/ControlRow.jsx)

We return a `<Toggle>` component with some properties:

 - `label` for the visible label
 - `name` for the button's name property
 - `key` is something React needs to tell similar components apart; it has to be unique
 - `value` for the button's initial value state
 - `onClick` for the click callback

These follow the common convention for form elements because it's the standard I got used to. It's a decent convention and there's no need to re-invent the wheel.

We also capitalize the first letter of the label, if that flag is set in our props. This is where those `String` class helper functions we defined earlier come into play.

Now that we defined that `onClick` callback, we have to at least stub the function to keep the build working. And we have to define initial state because we used `this.state.toggleValues`. It's easier than checking if the variable exists every time.

{crop-start-line=79,crop-end-line=94,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[makePick and default state](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/ControlRow.jsx)

We keep `makePick` empty for now because we'll define it later when we look at propagating events. It's there just to keep things working.

Using `componentWillMount` to define default state is an exception. You're supposed to set default state in the class constructor, but we don't have access to props there. You can't populate an object property before the property exists. Remember, constructors are called while an object is being created.

If you're not used to lodash's functional approach, the code in `componentWillMount` might look strange. It loops through the values returned by `getToggleNames` and builds a dictionary - or object - with those names as keys, and `false` as the value.

We're later going to use `this.state.toggleValues` in combination with the `makePick` callback to ensure users can only select one value per row of toggles.

#### Toggle-able buttons

After all that, we still don't have anything to show to the user. `ControlRow` tries to render a bunch of buttons, but our `Toggle` component returns `null` every time.

Let's go back to `src/components/H1BGraph/Controls/Toggle.jsx` and make it work. Here's what we need:

 - render a button
 - define its class based on toggle-ness
 - handle click events
 - eagerly update toggle-ness on clicks

Handling toggle-ness is going to be the tricky part. We want the buttons to feel fast, but also respond to upstream data changes.  

First, let's render the button. We add a few lines to the `render` method:

{crop-start-line=21,crop-end-line=40,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Toggle renders a button](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/Toggle.jsx)

We're using a basic HTML `<button>` element and giving it some React magic properties. `className` is an alias for the DOM `class` attribute. This is necessary because `class` is a reserved symbol in JavaScript. `onClick` defines a click event handler similar to using `$('selector').click(do_thing)`.

React gives us all the important event handlers in its `onSomething` magic properties. They might look like the DOM Level 2 event handlers from the early 2000's, but their implementation is cleaner. Don't worry if everyone has been telling you for the past 10 years not to use `onclick`. This usage is okay and has all the merits of using the newer *"find element, attach listener"* approach, I promise.

As you can see on line 8 of that example, we change the button's color based on `this.state.value`. (btn-primary is the Bootstrap class that makes buttons blue)

{crop-start-line=29,crop-end-line=31,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Toggle color switch](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/Toggle.jsx)

We only check `this.state.value` and don't worry about props vs. state issues in the `render` method. That comes next.

We need three different functions to make this work smoothly:

- `constructor`, which sets default state
- `componentWillReceiveProps`, which updates internal state when props update
- `handleClick`, which is the click event callback

{crop-start-line=50,crop-end-line=68,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[State and click handling in Toggle](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/Toggle.jsx)

You know the drill by now: `constructor` sets initial state dictionary to `{value: false}`, `componentWillReceiveProps` updates it when a new value comes down from above. This lets us both have internal state, and defer to global application state when needed.

The `handleClick` function toggles that same internal state. If it's `true` it becomes `false and vice-versa. Calling `setState` triggers a re-render and our button changes color.

Magic.

Using both state and props lets us change buttons the moment a user clicks them without waiting for the rest of the page to react. This makes user interactions feel snappier.

You should see a row of buttons under your histogram. Each can be toggled on and off, but nothing else happens yet. 

### Propagating events through the hierarchy

If we want the histogram to change when buttons are toggled, we have to propagate those click events through the hierarchy. The information being propagated is going to change each step of the way. This will reflect semantic changes in its meaning.

Toggles say something happened.

ControlRow says what happened.

Controls explains how to filter.

H1BGraph filters.

Our `Toggle` component is pretty much wired up already. It responds to user events in the `handleClick` method. Telling `ControlRow` that something happened is as easy as adding a function call.

{crop-start-line=102,crop-end-line=108,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Call event callback in handleClick](code_samples/es6/H1Bgraph/Controls/Toggle.jsx)

Notice how we can just call functions given in props? I love that. It's the simplest approach to inter-component interaction that I've ever seen.

And yes, I know, we have a leaky abstraction right here. The parent component gives us a callback via props, and the first argument is also a prop. Why does the toggle have to tell its name to the callback, when the callback comes from the same place that the name does?
  
Because it makes our code simpler. 

Let me show you. We implement the `makePick` function back in `src/components/H1BGraph/Controls/ControlRow.jsx`.

{crop-start-line=135,crop-end-line=148,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[makePick function in ControlRow component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/ControlRow.jsx)

Two things happen here:

1. We make sure only one value can be turned on at a time
2. We call `updateDataFilter` with the new value

For both of these we need the clicked toggle's name. When we use `_.mapValues` to reconstruct the `toggleValues` dictionary the name tells us which field should be set to `true`. When we call `updateDataFilter` it tells us the value we're filtering by.

Remember, we collected toggle names out of possible values for each filter. In the case of filtering by year, each year value became a toggle button.

If you click on a button now, you'll see it disables all the others. When `this.state.toggleValues` changes, it triggers a re-render, which pushes new props down to `Toggle` components, which then re-render themselves with the new `className`.

Neat.

---

Now we can go back to `src/components/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx` and implement that `updateDataFilter` callback we stubbed earlier.

We have to change the callback definition in `render`.

{crop-start-line=94,crop-end-line=105,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Change ControlRow callback](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

Same sort of code as always. If you don't like the `::` syntax sugar from ES7, you can use `this.updateDataFilter.bind(this)` instead.

Now here's the interesting part: We'll have to hold the current year filter function and value in memory, the component's state.  We have to do this so that we can build complex filters on multiple properties.
  
Each time a user clicks a toggle button, we only know the current selection and property. But we don't want to delete the filtering on, say, US state.

We have to define some default state in the constructor.

{crop-start-line=63,crop-end-line=72,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Default filter state](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

`yearFilter` is a dummy function, and `year` is an asterisk. It could be anything, but a few months from now, you will still recognize an asterisk as an anything goes value.

With that done, we need the `updateYearFilter` function itself. It looks like this:

{crop-start-line=74,crop-end-line=87,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[updateYearFilter function](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

Our filter is a function that checks for equality between the year in a datum and the year argument to `updateYearFilter` function itself. This works because of JavaScript's wonderful scoping, which means that functions carry their entire scope around. No matter where we pass the filter function to, the local variables that existed where it was defined, are always going to be there.

This might lead to memory leaks. Which is probably why Chrome takes some 10 gigabytes of memory on my laptop.

If the year is not defined, or reset is explicitly set to true, we reset the filter back to defaults.

Almost there! We are handling the in-state representation of the year filter. Now we have to tell the parent component, `H1BGraph`.

We do that in the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method. As you can guess, it gets called on every re-render, which is triggered every time we use `this.setState`.

{crop-start-line=141,crop-end-line=149,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Propagate filter changes up the hierarchy](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

For every update, we call `this.props.updateDataFilter`, which is the change callback defined by `H1BGraph` when it rends `Controls`. As the sole argument, we give it our filter wrapped in another function.

This looks far too complicated and it is. It will make more sense when we add another filter. Hint: this is where we combine multiple filters into a single function.

But whatever you do, *DON'T* click a button yet. Your code will go into an infinite loop and crash your browser tab.

That's because when React decides whether to update your component or not, it only performs a shallow state and props comparison. Because we rely on function changes, we need a better comparison.

{crop-start-line=151,crop-end-line=156,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Prevent infinite loops](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

With `shouldComponentUpdate` we can define a custom comparison function. In our case, using Lodash's `isEqual` between current and future state is good enough.

Crisis averted! You can click the buttons.

Just one thing left to do before the graph starts changing for every click: Use the new filters to filter data before rendering.

Go to `src/components/H1BGraph/index.jsx` and add this function:

{crop-start-line=508,crop-end-line=515,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Filter update callback](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

Guess what it does? Stores the new filter in `this.state`. 

Of course, this means we have to add a default filter in the constructor as well.

{crop-start-line=463,crop-end-line=473,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Default dataFilter](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

The default is a function that always says *"Yup, leave it in."*.

Now let's add all the heavy lifting to the `render` method. It looks like this:

{crop-start-line=531,crop-end-line=556,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Rendering filter data](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

A few things happened:

1. We passed our data through a filter
2. We feed filtered data into the `Histogram`
3. We gave `Controls` the correct callback

Yes, this means we filter the data from scratch every time the page re-renders for whatever reason. Turns out this is pretty fast and works well enough. Even with tens of thousands of data points.

And there you go. You have a histogram that changes its shape when you click a button.

Amazing.

Now let me show you just how reusable React components can be.

## Component reusability

All right, we have a filter for years. It looks like a row of buttons and users can select a specific year to focus the histogram.

Let's look at how reusable we've made the `ControlRow` component by adding another filter - US states.

Here's a quick rundown of what we're going to do:

1. Add another `ControlRow` to `Controls`
2. Build a list of US states from the data
3. Add an `udpateStateFilter` function to `Controls`
4. Add `stateFilter` to component state
5. Include `stateFilter` in `componentDidUpdate`

That's all we need. A few lines of copypasted code in `src/components/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx`. No changes necessary to either `ControlRow` or `Toggle`. No changes to anything to do with the graph itself either.

Adding a new ControlRow and building a list of US states, probably looks familiar by now.

{crop-start-line=236,crop-end-line=260,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Add another ControlRow](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

This adds a new `ControlRow` to render, gives it a function that extracts US states from the data, and a new update callback, which we'll define next.

{crop-start-line=209,crop-end-line=224,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Add a US state filter update](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

The new update filter callback is a copypaste of `updateYearFilter` with a few keywords changed. We *could* have been clever about it and implemented dynamic magic that would let us get away with a single function, but it's unnecessary. And it makes the code both harder to explain and to understand a few months down the line.

Now let's add the new US state filter to the main filter callback in `componentDidUpdate`.

{crop-start-line=224,crop-end-line=233,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Include the new filter in the main callback](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

See, this is why we went through the trouble of wrapping filters in another function. It lets us compose different filters into a single expression.

Finally, we need to define a default state for the US state filter. We do that in the class constructor.

{crop-start-line=185,crop-end-line=196,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Add default value for US state filter](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Controls/index.jsx)

Same as the year filter, different keynames.

If all went well, you should have a histogram with two rows of filters underneath. Users can choose a year *and* a US state to filter by.

![Histogram with two filters](images/more_buttons_histogram.png)

## Making disparate components act together

If you came this far, you have a nice histogram of H1B salaries in the software industry. It's blue and there's an axis. Everything renders on the front-end and changes when the user picks a specific year or US state. 

But a good visualization needs a title and a description. The title tells users what they’re looking at, and the description gives them the story.

As great as people are at understanding pictures, it goes much better when you flat-out *tell* them what they’re looking at.

The key to making disparate components act together is the data flow-down architecture. Because there is only one repository of truth and because every component renders from props, we can make every component on the page change when data changes.

This enables us to change the title and description together with the histogram, which in turn means that they can always be accurate and specific to what the user is currently looking at. They never have to think hard about the story behind the data, we can just tell them.

Marvelous.

----

We're going to build two components - a Title and a Description. They're going to share some common methods, which we'll put in a base component.

Let's start with the base component. It goes in `src/components/H1BGraph/Meta/BaseComponent.jsx`.

{crop-start-line=5,crop-end-line=21,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Stubbed base component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/BaseComponent.jsx)

The `BaseComponent` exports a `Meta` class which is all about common getters that both `Title` and `Description` are going to use. Extending from `Meta` will put functions from here into local scope so we can do stuff like `this.getYears()` and it calls the function from `Meta`.

Neat, huh? I think it is.

The function bodies themselves aren't too difficult. They go through the dataset and return lists of values. `getYears` returns all year values, `getUSStates` returns all states, and `getFormatter` returns a salary value formatter.

{crop-start-line=30,crop-end-line=61,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[The entire Meta base component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/BaseComponent.jsx)

See, nothing we haven't done before. Sprinkle some lodash functions for traversals and groupings, and use some d3 linear scale magic for the formatter.

Now let's stub out the `Title` and `Description` components real quick. That way we can add them to `H1BGraph` and let hot loading do its magic so we can see what we're adding in real time.

`Title` goes in `src/components/H1BGraph/Meta/Title.jsx`.

{crop-start-line=5,crop-end-line=20,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Stubbed Title component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/Title.jsx)

For now we return a dummy title just so we get something rendering. Notice that we extended from `Meta`, not `Component` like usual.

`Description` goes in `src/components/H1BGraph/Meta/Description.jsx`.

{crop-start-line=5,crop-end-line=20,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Stubbed Description component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/Description.jsx)

Same as before - dummy description and a few basic imports.

Both of those files imported a `StatesMap` file alongside `BaseComponent`. That's a mapping of US state shortcodes to full names.

You can get it from my github, [here](https://github.com/Swizec/h1b-software-salaries/blob/e032f5b131af4659c5f9a0981b9d85054d2b5a17/src/components/H1BGraph/Meta/StatesMap.jsx). It was a pain in the ass to make so I don't suggest doing it yourself. Put it in `src/components/H1BGraph/Meta/StatesMap.jsx`. If you're using the stub project, it's already there.

One last bit we need is a `src/components/H1BGraph/Meta/index.jsx` file to make importing easier.

{crop-start-line=2,crop-end-line=6,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Meta/index.jsx](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/index.jsx)

This looks weird. We have to do some roundabout hand waving so that we can both import and export classes with the same name. So called pass-through imports.

I don't know if that's the best way to do it, but it's what I came to after hours of banging my head against a wall. You can read the background behind these four lines of code [on my blog](http://swizec.com/blog/theres-a-bug-in-es6-modules/swizec/6753).

### Add Title and Description to the main view

Now that everything's stubbed out, adding the Title and Description components to the main view doesn't take much. We have to add three lines of code.

The import:

{crop-start-line=569,crop-end-line=574,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Import Title and Description](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

The render:

{crop-start-line=643,crop-end-line=656,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Add Title and Description to render method](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

That's it. If you have `npm start` running in the background, you should see something like this now:

![Histogram with dummy title and description](images/dummy_title_description.png)

### The title

Our titles are going to follow a formula like: “In <US state>, H1B workers in the software industry made $x/year in <year>”.

We start with the year fragment:

{crop-start-line=32,crop-end-line=45,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[getYearsFragment function](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/Title.jsx)

We get the list of years in the current data and return either an empty string or `in Year`. If there’s only one year, we assume it’s been filtered by year.

We make the same sort of assumptions for the US state fragment.

{crop-start-line=47,crop-end-line=62,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[getUSStateFragment function](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/Title.jsx)

Great, we've got the two dynamic pieces we need. Now let's put them together in the `render` method.

{crop-start-line=111,crop-end-line=136,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Title render method](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/Title.jsx)

Plenty going on here, but the gist of it is that big `if` statement:

- if both the years and US state fragments have content, our title is "In <State>, blahblah made $X/year in <Year>"
- if one or neither have content, our title is "Blahblah <made/make> $X/year <in State / in Year>"

The `$X/year` comes from combining the average salary in our dataset, calculated with `d3.mean`, and the number formatter. The rest is just about plugging both fragments in the right parts of the string.

Note that in the second case we still have to render both fragments because we don't know which one has content. They're syntactically interchangeable at this point. The sentence works the same if it ends "in California" or "in 2014".

Your histogram should look like this:

![Histogram with title](images/titled_histogram.png)

Now let's fix that description.

### The description

Our descriptions won’t be much more complicated than the titles. We'll need a sentence or two explaining what the histogram is showing and comparing it to the previous year.

We need two helper functions to get all data for a specific year or US state. This will help us do the last year look backs.

{crop-start-line=32,crop-end-line=47,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Description's getAllData functions](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/Meta/Description.jsx)

Not much happens here. They're just filter functions.

The `getPreviousYearFragment` function is more interesting.

{crop-start-line=79,crop-end-line=114,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Description getPreviousYearFragment function](code_samples/es6/Meta/Description.jsx)

Whoa, so much going on. We first get all the years in filtered data, then:

- if there's more than one, we stop
- if it's the first year in our dataset, we stop
- otherwise:
	- we get all datapoints for last year
	- get US states in filtered data
	- filter `lastYear` by US state if user filtered by that as well
	- if the factor between this and last year is big, return "X times more" fragment
	- otherwise return "X% more/less" fragment

That wasn't too bad, was it? I'm sure better ways exist to generate human text based on parameters, but there's no need to be fancy.

Now we need the year and US state fragments, same as the title. Their functions look like this:

{crop-start-line=178,crop-end-line=207,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Year and US state fragment functions](code_samples/es6/Meta/Description.jsx)

See, nothing special. You already know all this code from the `Title` component. The only difference is in the strings produced. This is also why we can't throw these two functions into `BaseComponent`.

Ok, now that we have all the helper functions, it's time to put them together. We do that in the `render` method. Like this:

{crop-start-line=298,crop-end-line=322,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Description render function](code_samples/es6/Meta/Description.jsx)

That is one beast of a return statement right there.

But it's not too bad when you take a closer look. The description can start with either "Since 2012" or "In <Year>". Then it adds the selected US state, the correct tense of "to give", the number `N` of H1Bs in our dataset, and the previous year fragment. In the end it adds info about the one standard deviation spread of salaries for selected year and US state.

We got those numbers using d3's default math functions. Assuming salaries follow a normal distribution, 68% of them fall within this 1-standard-deviation range.

This is the sort of assumption that would make your and my statistics professors cry. But it's good enough, I think. Given enough datapoints, everything becomes normally distributed according to the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) anyway.

You should have a histogram with a nice description now:

![Histogram with description](images/description_histogram.png)

Hooray, you’ve made a histogram of H1B salaries with a title and description that both change when the visualization changes. You’re awesome!

Now you know how to make React and d3.js work together. Woohoo!
