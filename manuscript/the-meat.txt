# Visualizing data with React and d3.js

Welcome to the main part of the book. I’m going to walk you through an example of building a simple visualization using React and d3.js.

We are going to build a subset of the code I used to [visualize the salary distribution of H1B workers](http://swizec.github.io/h1b-software-salaries/#2014-ca-engineer) in the United States software industry.

If you skipped the [section on setting up your environment](#the-environment), make sure you’ve got the following dependencies:

* d3.js
* React
* Bootstrap (for styling)
* Lodash

And you should have some way of starting a static file server locally. I like `live-server`.

We’re going to put all our code in a `src/` directory, and serve the compiled version out of `build/`. A `data/` directory is going to hold our data.

Before we begin, you should download the dataset from my Github repository, [here](https://github.com/Swizec/h1b-software-salaries/blob/65fac70fb44b23b1a9fe2ec923d246d654fb42e1/data/h1bs.csv). Save it in `data/`.

## The HTML skeleton

Even though we’re going to build the whole interface with React, we still need some HTML to start with. We have to include the code files and set up a container.

{linenos=off,lang=html}
<<[HTML skeleton](code/index-bare.html)

These 20 lines do everything we need. The `<head>` sets some meta properties recommended by Bootstrap and includes our stylesheet. The `<body>` sets up a container and includes the JavaScript code.

We didn’t necessarily have to use a `<div>` within a `<div>` like that, but it’s a good idea to avoid controling the whole `.container` with React in case you want to add stuff later.
