# The environment

Before we begin, let’s set up a work environment. We’re after three things:

 * page should auto-refresh when we make changes
 * our code should auto-compile when we save a file
 * a good way to manage dependencies and modules

To achieve these, we’re going to use Grunt, Browserify, Bower, and Npm. This will make coding a joy, and ultimately enable us to host our visualization on anything capable of serving static files. Even the free Github Pages will be enough.

And let me tell you, there’s nothing like free static page hosting when 25,000 visitors descend upon your site in four hours.

If you already know how to set this all up. Great! Skip to next chapter.

## NPM for server-side tols

NPM is node.js’s default package manager. Originally used only for dependency management in node.js projects, it seems to have taken hold of the JavaScript world as a way to manage the proverbial tool belt.

We’ll use it to install the other tools we need.

Make sure you have it by installing node.js from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org). Grunt, Bower, and our development server will run in node as well.

Once you’ve got it, create a working directory, navigate to it, and run:

    npm init .

This will create a `package.json` file, which stores some basic info about your project. Most importantly, it’s got a list of dev dependencies. This is useful when you return to a project months or years later, and can’t remember how to get it running.

Also great, if you want to share the code.

## The development server

Production servers are beyond the scope of this book, but we need a server running locally. You could work on a static website without one, but we’re loading data into the visualisation dynamically and that makes browser security models panic.

We’re going to use `live-server`, which is a great static server written in JavaScript. Its biggest advantage is that the page refreshes automatically when CSS, HTML, or JavaScript files in the current directory change.

Just run:

    npm install -g live-server

If all went well, you should be able to start the server by running `live-server` in the command line. It’s even nice enough to immediately open a browser tab pointing at `http://localhost:8080`.
