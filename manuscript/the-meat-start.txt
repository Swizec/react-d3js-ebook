# Visualizing data with React and d3.js

Welcome to the main part of React+d3.js. I’m going to walk you through an example of building a visualization using React and d3.js.

We're going to build a subset of the code I used to [visualize the salary distribution of H1B workers](http://swizec.github.io/h1b-software-salaries/#2014-ca-engineer) in the United States software industry.

![H1B salary distribution for engineers in California](images/engineers-california.png)

If you skipped the [environment setup section](#the-environment), make sure you’ve installed the following dependencies:

* d3.js
* React
* Lodash
* autobind-decorator

You should also have some way of running a static file server, and a way to compile JSX into pure JavaScript. I like having a simple node.js server that enables hot loading via Webpack, and compiling with Babel.

We’re going to put all our code in a `src/` directory, and serve the compiled version out of `static/`. A `public/data/` directory is going to hold our data.

Before we begin, you should copy the dataset from the stub project you got with the book. It should be in the `public/data/` directory of your project.

## The basic approach

Because SVG is an XML format that fits into the DOM, we can assemble it with React. To draw a `100px` by `200px` rectangle inside a grouping element moved to `(50, 20)` we can do something like this:

{title="A simple rectangle in React",linenos=off,lang=jsx}
    render: function () {
        return (
            <g transform="translate(50, 20)">
                <rect width="100" height="200" />
            </g>
        );
    }

If the parent component puts this inside an `<svg>` element, the user will see a rectangle. At first glance, this looks cumbersome compared to traditional d3.js. But look closely:

{title="A simple rectangle in d3.js",linenos=off,lang=js}
    d3.select("svg")
      .append("g")
      .attr("transform", "translate(50, 20)")
      .append("rect")
      .attr("width", 100)
      .attr("height", 200);

The d3.js approach outputs SVG as if by magic and looks cleaner because it's pure JavaScript. But it’s a lot more typing and function calls for the same result.

Well, actually, the pure d3.js example is 10 characters shorter. But trust me, React is way cooler.

My point is that dealing with the DOM is not d3.js’s strong suit, especially once you're drawing a few thousand elements and your visualization slows down to a leisurely stroll… if you’re careful.

You always have to keep an eye on how many elements you're updating. React gives you all of that for free. Its primary purpose in life is knowing exactly which elements to update when some data changes.

We're going to follow this simple approach:

* React owns the DOM
* d3 calculates properties

This way we leverage both React and d3.js for their best functions and not much else.

{#the-architecture}
## The architecture

To make our lives easier, we're going to use a flow-down architecture where the entire application state is stored in one place. The architecture itself inspired by Flux, but the way we're structuring it uses less code and is easier to explain. The downside is that our version doesn't scale as well as Flux would.

If you don't know about Flux, don't worry; the explanations are self-contained. I only mention Flux to make your Googling easier and to give you an idea of how this approach compares.

![The basic architecture](images/architecture.jpg)

The idea is this:

* The Main Component is the repository of truth
* Child components react to user events
* They announce changes up the chain of parents via callbacks
* The Main Component updates its truth
* The real changes flow back down the chain to update UI

This might look roundabout, but I promise, it’s awesome. It's definitely better than worrying about parts of the UI going out of date with the rest of the app.

![Data flows down](images/architecture_data.jpg)

Having your components rely solely on their properties is like having functions that rely only on their arguments. This means that if given the same arguments, they *always* render the same output.

If you want to read about this in more detail, Google "isomorphic JavaScript". You could also search for "referential transparency" and "idempotent functions".

Either way, functional programming for HTML. Yay!

## The HTML skeleton

We’re building the whole interface with React, but we still need to begin with some HTML. It's going to take care of including files and giving our UI a container.

Make an index.html file that looks like this:

{linenos=off,lang=html}
<<[HTML skeleton](code_samples/index.html)

These 20 lines do everything we need. The `<head>` sets some meta properties that Bootstrap recommends and includes Bootstrap's stylesheet. This is a good approach for when you only need Bootstrap's default styles and don't want to change anything. We'll use `require()` statements to load our own stylesheets with Webpack.

The `<body>` tag creates a container and includes the JavaScript code. We didn’t really need a `<div>` inside a `<div>` like that, but I like to avoid taking over the whole `.container` with React. This gives you more flexibility for adding dumb static content.

At the bottom, we load our compiled JavaScript from `static/bundle.js`. This is a virtual path created by our dev server, so it doesn't point to any actual files.

## Structuring your React app

As you can guess from the earlier chapter about architecture, we're going to structure your app into components. Deciding what to put into one component and what into another is one of the hardest problems in engineering.

Whole books have been written about that so here's a rule of thumb that I like to use: If you have to use the word "and" to describe what your component does, then it should become two components.

Once you have those two components, you can either make them child components of a bigger component, or you can make them separate. This depends on their re-usability.

For instance, to build our H1B histogram visualization, we are going to build two top-level components:

 - H1BGraph, which handles the whole UI
 - Histogram, which is a passive component for rendering labeled histograms

Histogram is going to be a child of H1BGraph in the final hierarchy, but we might use it somewhere else. That makes it a good candidate for a stand-alone component.

Other components such as the mean value line, filter controls, and title/description meta components are very specific to this use-case, so we'll build them as child components of H1BGraph. We still want to build them as separate components, and not as top-level parts of H1BGraph, so that they are easier to reason about, reusable locally within H1BGraph, and easier to write tests for.

We're not going to write tests here, though. That's a topic for another book. Right now we want to focus on React and d3.js.

Each component will have its own folder inside `src/components/`, or its parent component, and at least an `index.jsx` file. Some will also have style definitions, child components, and other JavaScript files.

In theory, each component should be accessible with `require('./MyComponent')`, and rendered with `<MyComponent {...params} />`. If a parent component has to know details about the implementation of a child component, something is going wrong.

You can read more about these ideas, if you google for ["leaky abstractions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction), ["single responsibility principle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), ["separation of concerns"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), and ["structured programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming). Books from the late 90's and early 2000's when object oriented programming was The Future (tm) are the best source of [curated] info in my experience.

## Bootstrap your app into place

Let's start by bootstrapping our app into place. We're going to make a simple `src/index.jsx` file - we sat that to be our main entry file in the environment section - and an empty `H1BGraph` component that renders an SVG element.

We start by importing `React`, `ReactDOM`, and `H1BGraph`.

{crop-start-line=5,crop-end-line=9,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Import main dependencies](code_samples/es6/index.jsx)

`React` is, well, React. We need it for just about everything. `ReactDOM` is React's DOM renderer, which is new in v0.14. Rendering got split out of base React so that it's easier to build React apps for different render targets like canvas, WebGL, native mobile, etc. And `H1BGraph` is going to be our main component.

We're using ES6 style imports instead of `require()` because it gives us greater flexibility to import just the parts we want and reads like a normal English sentence in most common use cases. You'll see this play out more in future examples.

The second argument must be a string even if you're importing a library.

The main entry point for the app is also a good place to define any convenience helper functions that should be available globally, but aren't big or important enough to make a new library for. We'll add `capitalize` and `decapitalize` to the `String` class. There are libraries out there that do this, but there's no need to add an entire string manipulation library to our codebase, if all we need are two functions.

{crop-start-line=13,crop-end-line=27,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Define two string helpers](code_samples/es6/index.jsx)

Now we'll be able to capitalize and decapitalize any string in our codebase with a call like `"some thing".capitalize()`. We're going to use this in the `Title` and `Description` meta components. We define them here because they change the global String class and it would be odd if that happened deep down in a child component ... maybe we should've just avoided changing built-in classes.

All we need now is to render `H1BGraph` into the page.

{crop-start-line=41,crop-end-line=50,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Render H1BGraph onto page](code_samples/es6/index.jsx)

This tells React to take control of the HTML element with class `h1bgraph` - a `<div>` inside the main container in our case - and render the `H1BGraph` component. We used `ReactDOM.render` because we're rendering for and in a browser. Other renderers exist, but they're not important for us right now.

You can think of this function call as a *"Give me a Thing That Does Stuff"*. It doesn't have to stand on its own. You could wrap it in a jQuery plugin, use it inside a Backbone or Angular view, or really in whatever you're already using. That's how you can make a gradual transition towards React that doesn't force you to throw existing code away.

If you've kept `npm start` running in the background, it should now complain that `components/H1BGraph` doesn't exist. Let's fix that and get an empty `<svg>` element rendering.

## Start with a basic component

All of our components are going to start the same way - some imports, a class with a `render()` method, and a default module export. That's the minimum we need in `<component>/index.jsx` to define a component that doesn't break our build.

Our build is breaking right now. The main entry file tries to import and render `H1BGraph`, but it doesn't exist. Let's start a new file in `src/components/H1BGraph/index.jsx`.

{crop-start-line=5,crop-end-line=6,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Basic imports](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

First we import React, and a base `Component` class. We have to import `React` even if we don't use it explicitly because we'll get a "React not defined" error otherwise. We'll use the `Component` class to build our own components off of.

{crop-start-line=10,crop-end-line=23,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Empty H1BGraph component](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

Then we define a component that renders an empty `<svg>` tag inside a `<div>`. A component must have at least a `render()` function, otherwise React throws an error when it tries to render.

We're using ES6's concept of classes and class inheritance to extend React's basic `Component`, which we imported earlier. This is widely accepted as more readable than JavaScript's old/standard prototypical inheritance.

You can still use `React.createClass` if you want. It works just fine and is equivalent to `class X extends Component`.

{crop-start-line=36,crop-end-line=43,linenos=off,lang=jsx}
<<[Export H1BGraph](code_samples/es6/H1BGraph/index.jsx)

In the end, we export `H1BGraph` so other parts of the codebase can import it. We define it as the `default` export because this particular file only exports a single class.

If we had multiple things to export, we'd use named exports. They look like this: `export Thing`. You can also define the Thing anonymously when exporting, like this: `export function Thing () { // ... }`.

Using default exports makes our components easier to import. You just have to write a simple import like we saw earlier: `import Thing from 'file'`. To import named exports, you have to specify them inside curly braces: `import { Thing1, Thing2 } from 'file'`.

Hot reloading and continuous compilation should have done their magic now, and you should see an empty `<svg>` element in your page. You have to keep `npm start` running and a browser window pointing to `localhost:3000` for that.

Congratz! You just made your first React component with ES6 classes. Or at least the first in this book. You're awesome!

Here's what happens next:

1. We'll make `H1BGraph` load our dataset
2. Build a Histogram component
3. Add dynamic meta text descriptions
4. Add some data filtering
